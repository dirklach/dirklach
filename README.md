## Designer & Developer

I am a passionate **Designer & Developer** who thrives on crafting seamless and visually appealing user experiences. My expertise lies in blending the art of design with the precision of development, ensuring every project is not only functional but also a joy to use.

Main focus on:

- **Nuxt:** Utilizing Nuxt.js for server-side rendering, static site generation, and improved SEO, all while maintaining a smooth development experience.
- **CSS:** Mastering the art of styling with modern CSS techniques, to create pixel-perfect layouts that are both responsive and cross-browser compatible.
- **Design Systems:** Developing consistent and scalable design systems to maintain visual coherence across projects.
- **GSAP:** Bringing designs to life with GreenSock Animation Platform, creating fluid, high-performance animations that enhance user engagement and interactivity.
